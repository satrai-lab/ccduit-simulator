# Experiment Scenarios Folder

This folder, "Experiment Scenarios," is provided for reference only and relates to the case study detailed in our paper. It includes scenarios focusing on the exchange of transportation data across federated networks, as outlined in Section VI of the paper. It briefly showcases the various steps required for each setup, along with a mix of dummy and real code that is used to estimate effort in regards to line of code for the simulator.

**Important:** There is no need to run or execute any files within this folder. The content here is solely for informational purposes to provide context and background for the scenarios used in our study and for the lines of code initialised in the simulator.

In short, the materials within help illustrate the steps for different kinds of interactions and variables initialization for the simulator but are not part of the active simulation environment.

Thank you for reviewing this reference material responsibly.
